        <p>Bands and musicians need to have a website that’s attractive to visitors and provides all of the necessary
            information fans will want to find. Here, we’ll feature 25 websites for your design inspiration.</p>

        <p>Most band or musician websites will have some things in common. Of course, they’ll usually include prominent
            photos of the artist or band. They’ll probably include a bio, tour dates, a shop to buy or download music,
            usually some song samples, and possibly a blog.</p>

        <p>Most band websites use large photos, full-screen backgrounds, video backgrounds, and other elements, like
            color, that make a strong visual impact on visitors. However, there are some that are a little more subtle
            and clean in the design style.</p>
